  abstract =      {We report on a technique to improve the continuous loading of atomic strontium into a magnetic trap from a magneto-optical trap. This is achieved by adding a depumping laser tuned to the P31→S31 (688-nm) transition. The depumping laser increases atom number in the magnetic trap and subsequent cooling stages by up to 65% for the bosonic isotopes and up to 30% for the fermionic isotope of strontium. We optimize this trap loading strategy with respect to the 688-nm laser detuning, intensity, and beam size. To understand the results, we develop a one-dimensional rate equation model of the system, which is in good agreement with the data. We discuss the use of other transitions in strontium for accelerated trap loading and the application of the technique to other alkaline-earth-like atoms.},

The high symmetry makes the model exactly solvable, which, in turn, enables the analytic study of dynamical processes such as spin diffusion in this SU($N$) system. We also show how to use this system to generate entangled states that allow for Heisenberg-limited metrology. This highly symmetric spin model should be experimentally realizable even when the vibrational levels are occupied according to a high-temperature thermal or an arbitrary non-thermal distribution.},

This transfer cavity may be used to stabilize another laser at an arbitrary wavelength, in the absence of atomic or molecular transitions suitable for stabilization. Implementation involves equipment and techniques commonly used in laser cooling and trapping laboratories and does not require electro- or acousto-optic modulators. With this technique we stabilize a transfer cavity using a rf current-modulated diode laser which is injection locked to a 780nm reference diode laser. The reference laser is stabilized using polarization spectroscopy in a Rb cell. A Ti:sapphire ring laser at 960nm is locked to this transfer cavity and may be precisely scanned by varying the rf modulation frequency. We demonstrate the suitability of this system for the excitation of laser cooled Rb atoms to Rydberg states.},

The scattering lengths show resonance behavior due to the appearance of a molecular bound state in a purely long-range interaction potential and are positive for magnetic fields below 50mT. A loss-rate model shows that losses should be smallest near zero magnetic field and for fields slightly larger than the resonance field, where the scattering length is also positive.},

  abstract = {The resolution of optical microscopy is limited by the numerical aperture and the wavelength of light. Many strategies for improving resolution such as 4Pi and I5M have focused on an increase of the numerical aperture. Other approaches have based resolution improvement in fluorescence microscopy on the establishment of a nonlinear relationship between local excitation light intensity in the sample and in the emitted light. However, despite their innovative character, current techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and ground-state depletion (GSD) microscopy require complex optical configurations and instrumentation to narrow the point-spread function. We develop the theory of nonlinear patterned excitation microscopy for achieving a substantial improvement in resolution by deliberate saturation of the fluorophore excited state. The postacquisition manipulation of the acquired data is computationally more complex than in STED or GSD, but the experimental requirements are simple. Simulations comparing saturated patterned excitation microscopy with linear patterned excitation microscopy (also referred to in the literature as structured illumination or harmonic excitation light microscopy) and ordinary widefield microscopy are presented and discussed. The effects of photon noise are included in the simulations.},

We make the first measurement of the 5s-6p matrix elements in rubidium by measuring the light shift around the 421 and 423 nm zeros through diffraction of a condensate off a sequence of standing wave pulses. In conjunction with existing theoretical and experimental data, we find 0.3235(9)ea0 and 0.5230(8)ea0 for the 5s-6p1/2 and 5s-6p3/2 elements, respectively, an order of magnitude more accurate than the best theoretical values. This technique can provide needed, accurate matrix elements for many atoms, including those used in atomic clocks, tests of fundamental symmetries, and quantum information.},

A near resonant laser beam is coherently scattered by the atomic array and its interference pattern is holographically recorded by superimposing it with a reference laser beam on a CCD chip. Fourier transformation of the recorded intensity pattern reconstructs the atomic distribution in the lattice with single-site resolution. The holographic detection method requires only a few hundred scattered photons per atom in order to achieve a high reconstruction fidelity. Therefore, additional cooling during detection might not be necessary even for light atomic elements such as lithium.},

We compare release-recapture measurements of the thermometer atoms to Monte-Carlo simulations while correcting for the non-thermalized fraction, and recover the cold cloud's temperature. The temperatures obtained are verified by independent time-of-flight measurements of the cold cloud's temperature. We also check the reliability of our simulations by first numerically modelling the unperturbed in-trap motion of single atoms in absence of the cold cloud, and second by performing release-recapture thermometry on the cold cloud itself. Our findings pave the way for local temperature probing of quantum systems in non-equilibrium situations.},

Light fields can form versatile potential landscapes, such as optical lattices, for neutral and charged atoms, while avoiding detrimental implications of established radiofrequency traps. Ions interact via long-range Coulomb forces and permit control and detection of their motional and electronic states on the quantum level. Here we show optical trapping of 138Ba+ ions in the absence of radio-frequency fields via a far-detuned dipole trap, suppressing photon scattering by three orders of magnitude and the related recoil heating by four orders of magnitude. To enhance the prospects for optical as well as hybrid traps, we demonstrate a method for stray electric field compensation to a level below 9 mV m-1. Our results will be relevant, for example, for ion-atom ensembles, to enable 4-5 orders of magnitude lower common temperatures, accessing the regime of ultracold interaction and chemistry, where quantum effects are predicted to dominate.},

As the alignment angle is varied, the mean-field shift shows a characteristic angular dependence, which constitutes the defining signature of the quadrupole interaction. For the 3P2 states of Yb and Sr atoms, we find a frequency shift of the order of tens of Hertz, which can be realistically detected in experiment with current technology.

  abstract = {A novel, simple, and inexpensive calibration scheme for a continuous-wave difference frequency spectrometer is presented, based on the stabilization of an open transfer cavity by locking onto the output of a polarization stabilized HeNe laser. High frequency, acoustic fluctuations of the transfer cavity length are compensated with a piezoelectric transducer mounted mirror, while long term drift in cavity length is controlled by thermal feedback. A single mode Ar+ laser, used with a single mode ring dye laser in the difference frequency generation of 2-4 μm light, is then locked onto a suitable fringe of this stable cavity, achieving a very small long term drift and furthermore reducing the free running Ar+ linewidth to about 1 MHz. The dye laser scan provides tunability in the difference frequency mixing process, and is calibrated by marker fringes with the same stable cavity. Due to the absolute stability of the marker cavity, precise frequency determination of near infrared molecular transitions is achieved via interpolation between these marker fringes. It is shown theoretically that the residual error of this scheme due to the dispersion of air in the transfer cavity is quite small, and experimentally that a frequency precision on the order of 1 MHz per hour is routinely obtained with respect to molecular transitions.},

Using 174Yb, we achieve an experimental cycle time as low as (1.6-1.8) s for the production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of (0.5-1) x 10^5 atoms. While laser cooling to 30\muK proceeds in a standard way, evaporative cooling is highly optimized by performing it in an optical trap that is dynamically shaped by utilizing the time-averaged potential of a single laser beam moving rapidly in one dimension. We also produce large (>10^6) atom number BECs and successfully model the evaporation dynamics over more than three orders of magnitude in phase space density. Our method provides a simple and general approach to solving the problem of long production times of quantum degenerate gases.},

  abstract =      {We present a novel approach to enhancing the bandwidth of a feedback-controlled mechanical system by digitally canceling acoustical resonances (poles) and anti-resonances (zeros) in the open-loop response via an FPGA FIR filter. By performing a real-time convolution of the feedback error signal with an inverse filter, we can suppress arbitrarily many poles and zeros below 100 kHz, each with a linewidth down to 10 Hz. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by canceling the ten largest mechanical resonances and anti-resonances of a high-finesse optical resonator, thereby enhancing the unity gain frequency by more than an order of magnitude. This approach is applicable to a broad array of stabilization problems including optical resonators, external cavity diode lasers, and scanning tunneling microscopes, and points the way to applying modern optimal control techniques to intricate linear acoustical systems.es to intricate linear acoustical systems.},

* Current noise in a resistor scales with the current across the junction
* Typically it has a 1/f PSD, and "rounds off at the point where it equals the thermal noise" -- eg, white noise floor is given by johnson noise; current noise dominates like 1/f at low frequencies.
* Magnitude depends heavily on type of resistor/technology (eg, thin film, thick film, etc.)
* Define "noise quality index", which is the RMS voltage noise divided by the DC voltage, in a single decade (fun fact: 1/f noise has constant RMS power in any decade!) -- eg, 0dB noise index = 1uV/V per decade.},

  abstract = {We have measured the 1f voltage noise in continuous metal films. At room temperature, samples of pure metals and bismuth (with a carrier density smaller by 105) of similar volume had comparable noise. The power spectrum SV(f) was proportional to V¯2Ωfγ, where V¯ is the mean voltage across the sample, Ω is the sample volume, and 1.0<~γ<~1.4. SV(f)V¯2 was reduced as the temperature was lowered. Manganin, with a temperature coefficient of resistance (β) close to zero, had no discernible noise. These results suggest that the noise arises from equilibrium temperature fluctuations modulating the resistance to give SV(f)~V¯2β2kBT2CV, where CV is the total heat capacity of the sample. The noise was spatially correlated over a length λ(f)~(Df)12, where D is the thermal diffusivity, implying that the fluctuations obey a diffusion equation. The usual theoretical treatment of spatially uncorrelated temperature fluctuations gives a spectrum that flattens at low frequencies in contradiction to the observed spectrum. However, the empirical inclusion of an explicit 1f region and appropriate normalization lead to SV(f)V¯2~β2kBT2CV[3+2ln(lw)]f, where l is the length and w is the width of the film, in excellent agreement with the measured noise. If the fluctuations are assumed to be spatially correlated, the diffusion equation can yield an extended 1f region in the power spectrum. We show that the temperature response of a sample to δ- and step-function power inputs has the same shape as the autocorrelation function for uncorrelated and correlated temperature fluctuations, respectively. The spectrum obtained from the cosine transform of the measured step-function response is in excellent agreement with the measured 1f voltage noise spectrum. Spatially correlated equilibrium temperature fluctuations are not the dominant source of 1f noise in semiconductors and discontinuous metal films. However, the agreement between the low-frequency spectrum of fluctuations in the mean-square Johnson-noise voltage and the resistance fluctuation spectrum measured in the presence of a current demonstrates that in these systems the 1f noise is also due to equilibrium resistance fluctuations.},
