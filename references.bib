  abstract =      {It is demonstrated that rf current modulation of a frequency stabilized injection-locked diode laser allows the stabilization of an optical cavity to adjustable lengths, by variation of the rf frequency. This transfer cavity may be used to stabilize another laser at an arbitrary wavelength, in the absence of atomic or molecular transitions suitable for stabilization. Implementation involves equipment and techniques commonly used in laser cooling and trapping laboratories and does not require electro- or acousto-optic modulators. With this technique we stabilize a transfer cavity using a rf current-modulated diode laser which is injection locked to a 780nm reference diode laser. The reference laser is stabilized using polarization spectroscopy in a Rb cell. A Ti:sapphire ring laser at 960nm is locked to this transfer cavity and may be precisely scanned by varying the rf modulation frequency. We demonstrate the suitability of this system for the excitation of laser cooled Rb atoms to Rydberg states.},

This allows precise repeatability and improved accuracy and stability. It also allows the driver to be placed near the laser for reduced noise and for lower phase lag when using the modulation input. We present the theory of operation for our driver in detail, and give a thorough characterization of its stability, noise, set-point accuracy and repeatability, temperature dependence, transient response, and modulation bandwidth.},

  abstract = {A novel, simple, and inexpensive calibration scheme for a continuous-wave difference frequency spectrometer is presented, based on the stabilization of an open transfer cavity by locking onto the output of a polarization stabilized HeNe laser. High frequency, acoustic fluctuations of the transfer cavity length are compensated with a piezoelectric transducer mounted mirror, while long term drift in cavity length is controlled by thermal feedback. A single mode Ar+ laser, used with a single mode ring dye laser in the difference frequency generation of 2-4 μm light, is then locked onto a suitable fringe of this stable cavity, achieving a very small long term drift and furthermore reducing the free running Ar+ linewidth to about 1 MHz. The dye laser scan provides tunability in the difference frequency mixing process, and is calibrated by marker fringes with the same stable cavity. Due to the absolute stability of the marker cavity, precise frequency determination of near infrared molecular transitions is achieved via interpolation between these marker fringes. It is shown theoretically that the residual error of this scheme due to the dispersion of air in the transfer cavity is quite small, and experimentally that a frequency precision on the order of 1 MHz per hour is routinely obtained with respect to molecular transitions.},

By performing a real-time convolution of the feedback error signal with an inverse filter, we can suppress arbitrarily many poles and zeros below 100 kHz, each with a linewidth down to 10 Hz. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by canceling the ten largest mechanical resonances and anti-resonances of a high-finesse optical resonator, thereby enhancing the unity gain frequency by more than an order of magnitude. This approach is applicable to a broad array of stabilization problems including optical resonators, external cavity diode lasers, and scanning tunneling microscopes, and points the way to applying modern optimal control techniques to intricate linear acoustical systems.es to intricate linear acoustical systems.},

* Current noise in a resistor scales with the current across the junction
* Typically it has a 1/f PSD, and "rounds off at the point where it equals the thermal noise" -- eg, white noise floor is given by johnson noise; current noise dominates like 1/f at low frequencies.
* Magnitude depends heavily on type of resistor/technology (eg, thin film, thick film, etc.)
* Define "noise quality index", which is the RMS voltage noise divided by the DC voltage, in a single decade (fun fact: 1/f noise has constant RMS power in any decade!) -- eg, 0dB noise index = 1uV/V per decade.},

  abstract = {We have measured the 1f voltage noise in continuous metal films. At room temperature, samples of pure metals and bismuth (with a carrier density smaller by 105) of similar volume had comparable noise. The power spectrum SV(f) was proportional to V¯2Ωfγ, where V¯ is the mean voltage across the sample, Ω is the sample volume, and 1.0<~γ<~1.4. SV(f)V¯2 was reduced as the temperature was lowered. Manganin, with a temperature coefficient of resistance (β) close to zero, had no discernible noise. These results suggest that the noise arises from equilibrium temperature fluctuations modulating the resistance to give SV(f)~V¯2β2kBT2CV, where CV is the total heat capacity of the sample. The noise was spatially correlated over a length λ(f)~(Df)12, where D is the thermal diffusivity, implying that the fluctuations obey a diffusion equation. The usual theoretical treatment of spatially uncorrelated temperature fluctuations gives a spectrum that flattens at low frequencies in contradiction to the observed spectrum. However, the empirical inclusion of an explicit 1f region and appropriate normalization lead to SV(f)V¯2~β2kBT2CV[3+2ln(lw)]f, where l is the length and w is the width of the film, in excellent agreement with the measured noise. If the fluctuations are assumed to be spatially correlated, the diffusion equation can yield an extended 1f region in the power spectrum. We show that the temperature response of a sample to δ- and step-function power inputs has the same shape as the autocorrelation function for uncorrelated and correlated temperature fluctuations, respectively. The spectrum obtained from the cosine transform of the measured step-function response is in excellent agreement with the measured 1f voltage noise spectrum. Spatially correlated equilibrium temperature fluctuations are not the dominant source of 1f noise in semiconductors and discontinuous metal films. However, the agreement between the low-frequency spectrum of fluctuations in the mean-square Johnson-noise voltage and the resistance fluctuation spectrum measured in the presence of a current demonstrates that in these systems the 1f noise is also due to equilibrium resistance fluctuations.},
