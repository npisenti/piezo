@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="One drawback of this scheme is that the contribution of $\protect \text  {V}_\protect \text  {mod}$ is not sensed by the monitor. Future versions will instead monitor $\protect \text  {V}_\protect \text  {out}$ through a resistive divider, allowing the microcontroller to implement an infinite integrator and drive $\protect \text  {V}_\protect \text  {mod}$ to \SI {0}{\volt } in closed-loop operation. This will be a very useful feature to prevent the servo controller from railing."}
